# Final_Project
📋 Project Overview
Green Pips is a responsive trading website built as part of a final design project. The goal was to replicate the card layout from a large-screen mockup while creatively implementing small (SM) and medium (MD) screen designs. The site was developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


All colors meet WCAG AA contrast compliance (checked via WebAIM Contrast Checker).

📱 Breakpoint Logic
LG (≥1024px) – Based on the provided mockup.

Card sizes, spacing, and layout match the design.

MD (640px–1023px) – Tablet view:

Layouts stack vertically where needed.

Cards become full-width with additional padding.

Simplified navbar.

SM (<640px) – Mobile view:

Full vertical stacking for all components.

Collapsible navbar (optional in bonus).

Hidden decorative elements for readability and speed.

🧠 Creative Divergences
Branding: Reimagined the site as Green Pips, a modern and user-focused trading education platform.

Typography & Icons: Swapped out default placeholder content with themed messaging and icons aligned with fintech branding.

Color Scheme: Applied a calming, growth-oriented palette rather than using the mockup’s style.
